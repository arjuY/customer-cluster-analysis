# Clustering and Analysis of Mall Customers
Probelm: The sales team of mall store wants to understand their customers and identify patterns to help them sever better and generate more profit. They created a dataset collecting the age, gender, annual income and spending score to find patterns into it.

To solve this problem, we perform K-Means clustering on the data and perform cluster analysis to get insights of the customers. Using the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters and performing clustering on the data we discover the customers that can be targeted by the store to improve the profit.
